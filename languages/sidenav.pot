"Some themes will have a visibility override set at a high value in order to "
"assure that a section on the page is visible on top of another section of "
"the page. This element is called a z-index. You may be required to set a "
"very high z-index by using the Set Visibility setting above in order to get "
"the SideNav to show. Try a few settings above 9000 first then push it higher "
"if the menu is not visible yet. 99999 should be exceedingly high and would "
"not be reccommended unless it is the only thing that works. Otherwise this "
"tells you that the theme may not be compatible with SideNav."
