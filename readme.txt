== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q.: Can I change the background colors for hover?
A.: If you know CSS then you can use any CSS editor to add a selctor in your Customizer or and other stylesheet. We intentionally left out this option so there would not be any conficlts with theme styles. You may find that the plugin will automatically recognize your anchor links a style accordingly. Otherwise the plugin selector is noted in the Sidenav Settings Control Panel.
